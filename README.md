# Book Notes

- Book Notes is a project that we have done for the Udemy course "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2023 (by The App Brewery)";

# Instructions

### Overview

> I read a lot of books but after I finish reading them I often don't remember all the most salient parts of the book. So I started taking notes. This capstone project is built on this idea. My friend Derek Sivers has this fantastic website where he has all the non-fiction books he has read, his notes, his ratings and when he read them. The books are sortable by rating, recency and title. It's a such cool idea for a project so I'm including it as a capstone here in this course.
